Decision: What architectural or technical choice was made?
Write a testing program to ping the API for current updates on the tint level of the window.

Context: What problem, need, or situation led to this decision?
Alex said that when they tested the response from the system, it was giving non logical answers. Being able to properly read what tint level the window is at will allow future proofing for if the window changes in speed of tinting.

Options considered: What alternatives were evaluated?
We could chose to not do anything about this.
Write a testing program to ping the API for current updates on the tint level of the window.
Write a simple call and use the non logical data

Rationale: Why was this option chosen? What were the trade-offs?
Being able to properly read what tint level the window is at will allow future proofing for if the window changes in speed of tinting.

Consequences: What are the implications, risks, or follow-up actions?
This should not be very complicated, should be low weight on the program, and not of high importance.
